<p> Madeon, named Hugo Pierre Leclercq, is a French DJ/electronic artist. I first began listening to Madeon in 2010 after hearing his "Raise you Weapon (remix)." It did not take long for my friends and I to be constatly listening to his music, enjoying songs such as "Icarus", or "The City." When he went on his Adventure Live Tour in 2015, I was fortunate enough to go to see him in Minneapolis, and just recently in October I got to see him again on tour with Porter Robinson, for the "Shelter Live Tour." While I won't go into too much detail, I really just want to spread the music.</p>
<p> If you really want to read his entire history, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeon">here</a> is a link to his Wikipedia<p>
