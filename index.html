<p>On Madeon's official page there is a link to try his Adventure Machine, what this essentially is, is you mixing your own sounds based on samples from his Album. It's really fun. This site is good because it is fun, gets you listenting to music, and feels smooth. There are plenty of elements that I don't recognize, like the inclusion of an app, but I can more or less read the basics of it.</p>
